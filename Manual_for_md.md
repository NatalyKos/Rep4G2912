# Welcome to Markdown! Wanna know how I did this?

Just put # in the beginning of the sentence, then leave a space, and then enter the text

#This is what happens when you don't leave a space between # and the text. Don't do that, you are not on Twitter

## This is a smaller head text. How did this happen?

Just put ## in the beginning, then leave a space, and enter your text

You should always leave a blank line between paragraphs

Otherwise it will look like this: Somebody once told me
The world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

And this is what the text looks like with blank lines:

Somebody once told me

The world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was looking kind of dumb

With her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

**Suppose you want to emphasize something with bold text**

Just put ** before the text you need to emphasize, enter the text without space and put ** in the end, also without a space

*You can also have italics in Markdown*

Put * before the text you need to italicize, enter the text without space and put * in the end, also without a space
